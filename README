Known Issues
------------

### stable node 1377

Inserts are working, but due a bug you wont see progress.
Fixed upstream (grab/pick 3e66ed5), in theory 1378 should include this ;)

### Konqueror+WebKit

Bah. With 4.6.2 / 4.6.3 I got some html page saved instead the expected fblob.
Switch Konqueror to use KHtml, this should work.
[Update] With 4.6.5 same problem.
